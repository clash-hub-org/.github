# Support Clash Hub 🏰

Hi! I'm the developer behind **Clash Hub**. 

I built this platform to help the Clash of Clans community manage their clans and villages in a more visual and efficient way. Maintaining servers, databases, and image services comes with a monthly cost.

If you like what I do and want to help me keep the project alive and ad-free, you can buy me a coffee!

### Ways to support:

*   **Buy Me a Coffee**: [Your BuyMeACoffee link here]
*   **PayPal**: [Your PayPal link here]
*   **GitHub Sponsors**: If you prefer monthly support.

Every small contribution goes directly towards paying for cloud infrastructure (Coolify, Postgres, Redis) and keeping me motivated to keep adding awesome features.

**Thanks for being part of the community!**
